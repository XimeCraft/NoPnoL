# NoPnoL - No Prejudice, No Label

## Introduction

NoPnoL aims to address the inherent bias in machine learning models that often emerges from imbalanced real-world data distributions. While ML models strive for accuracy by fitting to real-world patterns, these patterns may perpetuate existing societal biases. This platform seeks to bridge the gap between "precise reality fitting" and "active fairness promotion" by firstly, providing objective, statistics-based analysis of potentially biased topics.

Although finding the perfect balance between these two goals remains challenging, I believe it's crucial to at least make visible what we might be sacrificing in pursuit of model accuracy.

The name "NoPnoL" stands for "No Prejudice, No Label," reflecting our mission to showcase a world free from preconceptions and unfair categorizations.
